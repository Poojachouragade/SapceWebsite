				     <div class="projcard-description">
                        More than 300 years ago,
                     a scientist named Isaac Newton laid out three basic laws that describe the way things move. 
                     One of the laws says that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
                     This is the most important idea behind how rockets work. If you see pictures or videos of a launch,
                      you’ll see exhaust streaming out the bottom of the rocket. 
                     Exhaust is the flames, hot gases and smoke that come from burning the rocket’s propellants. 
                     The exhaust pushes out of a rocket’s engine down toward the ground.

				<div class="projcard-bar"></div>
				<div class="projcard-description">It’s not that simple. Earth’s gravity is still pulling down on the rocket.
                     When a rocket burns propellants and pushes out exhaust, that creates an upward force called thrust.
                      To launch, the rocket needs enough propellants so that the thrust pushing the rocket up is greater than 
                      the force of gravity pulling the rocket down. A rocket needs to speed up to at least 17,800 miles per hour—and
                       fly above most of the atmosphere, in a curved path around Earth. </div>

				<div class="projcard-description">Let’s say you want to launch a satellite that orbits Earth.
					 The rocket will launch, and when it gets to a specific distance from Earth, 
					 it will release the satellite. The satellite stays in orbit because it still has
					  momentum—energy it picked up from the rocket—pulling it in one direction. Earth’s gravity
					   pulls it in another direction. This balance between gravity and momentum keeps the 
					   satellite orbiting around Earth..</div>

				<div class="projcard-bar"></div>
				<div class="projcard-description">Satellites that orbit close to Earth feel a stronger
					 tug of Earth’s gravity. To stay in orbit, they must travel faster than a satellite
					  orbiting farther away. The International Space Station orbits about 250 miles above the 
					  Earth and travels at a speed of about 17,150 miles per hour. Compare that to the Tracking
					   and Data Relay Satellites, which help us get information to and from other NASA missions.
					    These satellites orbit at a height of more than 22,000 miles and
					 travel much slower—about 6,700 miles per hour—to maintain their high orbit.</div>
